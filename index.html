         A dog is a mammal in the order Carnivora.
         The history of dogs is an old tale indeed. You could say as long as 
         there has been civilisation, there have been records of humans and dogs. 
         Dogs were domesticated from wolves around 15,000 years ago. New evidence
         suggests that dogs were first domesticated in East Asia, possibly China. 
         Over time, the dog has developed into hundreds of breeds with a great 
         degree of variation.

         Dogs, like humans, are highly social animals and this similarity in their
         overall behavioural pattern accounts for their trainability, playfulnes and
         ability to fit into human households and social situations. This similarity
         has earned dogs a unique position in the realm of inter species relationships.

      <p> The loyalty and devotion that dogs demonstrate as part of their natural instincts 
         as pack animals closely mimics the human idea of love and friendship, leading many
         dog owners to view their pets as full-fledged family members.

         The common name for the domestic dog is ‘Canis familiaris‘, a species of the dog 
         family ‘Canidae’. The dog is generally considered the ‘first’ domesticated animal.

         Dogs can differ in appearance, function, temperament and size. Some small dogs can
         weigh as little as 1.5 pounds, whereas some larger dogs can weigh as much as 200 pounds.
         
         Depending on the country, there are about 138 officially recognised dog breeds.

         Dogs fill a variety of roles in human society and are often trained as working dogs. 
         For dogs that do not have traditional jobs, a wide range of dog sports provide the 
         opportunity to exhibit their natural skills.

         It is estimated that for more than 12,000 years the dog has lived with humans as a
         hunting companion, protector and friend. A dog is one of the most popular pets in
         the world and has been referred to as ‘mans best friend’. Whether you are poor or rich,
         a dog will be faithful and loyal to you and love you to bits.
